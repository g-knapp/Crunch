This is the starter template for CS312 projects based on Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). _The project is a forum and community building site where Middlebury college users can make image-based posts and comment on posts that others have made. The goal is to facilitate community among students and provide an informal and semi-anonymous gathering space._

The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and includes a number of additional libraries, including the Rest Testing Library, Jest, and ESLint, among others. It also includes the basic configuration for using Travis CI.

To ensure consistent style, this template is also set up with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), with the configuration to automatically reformat code during a commit. That is whenever you commit your code, Prettier will automatically reformat your code during the commit process (as a "hook"). The hook is specified in the `package.json` file.
