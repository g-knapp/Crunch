This project is a forum-based website created by Griffin Knapp and his other teammates for CS312 at Middlebury College. The primary files that Griffin contributed to are in "src/components". Specifically these are "PostContainer.js", "PostEditor.js", "Navbar.js", "Layout.js", "LandingPage.js", and "Comment.js". Other contributions are the pagination in the "index.js" file as well as the authorization and API functionality.
