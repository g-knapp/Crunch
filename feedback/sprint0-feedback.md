### Discussion

You should update how you display the Travis badge. You want to display it as an image, not a web link.

Three of you did not submit the screenshots showing successful local deployment (Griffin, Jake and Sammy), and two of you gave me screenshots that didn't include the URL so I can't see that it is running locally (Halcyon and Michael).

On the project setup side, I will suggest making an additional column in your project, and separate out material (like CRC cards) from backlog.

Looking at the design, I'm still not sure that you know exactly what this site _is_ (at least it doesn't come across in the documents provided). Your user stories are both overly specific and quite vague. The most "epic" of them seems to be "As a user, i want to be able to create forum posts so that I can engage with the Middlebury community". What is a forum post? What does it mean to "engage with the Middlebury community"? I realize that I am asking you to justify social media, but... you are going to create a new social media site, so why? What need does it fill? Why post here instead of Reddit or Facebook or whatever? What kinds of posts? Think big first: "As a user I want a website where I can find X because Y", where X is the content you hope to have there and Y is the real desire.

For example, let's take one of the real reasons that I visit Reddit. "As a user, I want a website with amusing content that requires minimal attention or time commitment so I have something to occupy me in random spare moments when I need to be half aware of what is going on around me and could be interrupted at any moment."

Or, for another reason I visit Reddit, "As a cigar box guitar builder, I want an online community where I can find videos about playing CBGs, get building tips, and get inspired by other builds because I want to become a better player and builder and there is no local community I could be part of."

I'm not suggesting that you need to build the community I am looking for, but this is the level of detail you might think about. I realize that you are working from a shared sense of "you know, a forum". I just think you need to push that a little harder and challenge some of your assumptions. For example, why allow comments? From your user stories, it is apparently "so you can contribute". Contribute what? Online comment sections can be cesspits. Doesn't making a post count as "contributing"? There are justifications for comments: comments can make a user feel validated for having posted the original post, comments allow other users to express their validation... or disagreement. There is the warm glow of knowing that someone somewhere online is wrong and that you have set them right.

I would like to see you write some additional epics to really justify why the Middlebury community would want to use this site. I'm pushing on this because what you come up with will trickle down to the whole of your design.

I do like that you have a lot of lo-fi prototypes scattered through the issues. It would be nice to create an issue that collects some of those in one place so you have a place you can consult for the big vision.

The data model seems okay, though I suspect it will evolve a bit as you start trying to tie everything together.
